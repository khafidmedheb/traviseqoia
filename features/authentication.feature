Feature: Authentication
  In order to gain access to the site management area
  As an admin
  I need to be able to login and logout

  Scenario: Logging in
    Given I am on "/login"
    When I follow "Log in" 
    And I fill in "Username" with "testname"
    And I fill in "Password" with "toto"
    And I press "Log in"
    Then I should be on ""
    And I should see "Welcome to Symfony 4.1.3"

  Scenario: Not logging in
    Given I am on "/login"
    When I follow "Log in" 
    And I fill in "Username" with "toto"
    And I fill in "Password" with "toto123"
    And I press "Log in"
    Then I should see "Invalid credentials."
